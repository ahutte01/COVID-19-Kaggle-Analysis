# COVID-19-Kaggle-Analysis
Analyzing the dataset available from Kaggle

Using NLTK Vader and Texblob, perform analysis to determine the difference in sentiment of COVID-19 publications Titles and Abstracts. How does the length of our text cause our polarity to increase? Titles are generally more neutral than Abstracts. Abstracts tend to be more polarizing, either strongly Positive or strongly Negative. These results occurred in both the VADER and TextBlob Scores. Wordclouds were generated to see major words to group sentiment of articles together in future research.
