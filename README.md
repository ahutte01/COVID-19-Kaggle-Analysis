# COVID-19-Kaggle-Analysis
Analyzing the dataset available from Kaggle

Using NLTK Vader and Texblob, perform analysis to determine the difference in sentiment of COVID-19 publications Titles and Abstracts. How does the length of our text cause our polarity to increase? Titles are generally more neutral than Abstracts. Abstracts tend to be more polarizing, either strongly Positive or strongly Negative. These results occurred in both the VADER and TextBlob Scores. Wordclouds were generated to see major words to group sentiment of articles together in future research. 

When comparing the full body text of the articles, the full body text is generally less strong than the Abstracts. Therefore, there is no clear relationship between the length of words in these articles and the extremity of the polarity of the articles. The titles are the most neutral, then body of the text, and then the abstracts of the texts.
